"woojinc" is a simple interpreter and compiler created for the programming course performance assessment at my school, Sunrin Internet High School. "woojinc" compiles and interprets the "woojinc" language, which we newly devised with minimal syntax for the purpose of creating a compiler and interpreter during the short C language project period in the programming course. The file extension for "woojinc" is ".wjc". Additionally, woojinc started with the intention to tease my friend named Shin Woojin.
